    <h2>Authorization Required</h2>
    <hr>
    <!-- Developer note: if you have *never* seen the user before, they'll need to authorize your app.
        It's most reliable to do so in a popup due to add-ons being presented in an iframe. -->
    <a target="popup" id="auth-user" href="{{ url_for('authorize') }}">
        <img src="../static/btn_google_signin_dark_normal_web.png" alt="Authorize the user">
    </a>
    <br>This will immediately start the authorization flow in a popup.
    <br>This should only be necessary once per user, unless your app has changed scopes or they
    have revoked their credentials.
    <br>Once complete, close the popup and use the other links below.
