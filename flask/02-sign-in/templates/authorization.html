    <h2>Authorization Required</h2>
    <hr>
    <!--
        Developer note: if you have *never* seen the user before, they'll need to
        authorize your app. It's most reliable to do so in a popup due to add-ons
        being presented in an iframe.
        Note that this link also calls a function to close the iframe; since we
        won't know when the user has finished the authorization flow, we won't
        be able to reload the addon with their correct credentials. -->
    <a target="popup" onclick="closeAddonIframe()" href="{{ url_for('authorize') }}">
        <img src="../static/btn_google_signin_dark_normal_web.png" alt="Authorize the user">
    </a>
    <br>This will immediately start the authorization flow in a popup.
    <br>This should only be necessary once per user, unless your app has changed scopes or they
    have revoked their credentials.
    <br>Once complete, close the popup and use the other links below.
