        Developer note: if you have *never* seen the user before, they'll need to
        authorize your app. It's most reliable to do so in a popup due to add-ons
        being presented in an iframe.

        <img src="../static/btn_google_signin_dark_normal_web.png" alt="Authorize the user">
    </a>
    <br>This will immediately start the authorization flow in a popup.
    <br>This should only be necessary once per user, unless your app has changed scopes or they
    have revoked their credentials.
